I am focusing on Dataflow Matrix Machines which perform neuromorphic computations with arbitrary linear streams.

Dataflow Matrix Machines allow us to obtain general-purpose **continuously deformable programs** 
and neural machines with convenient and flexible 
**self-modification facilities for compositional metalearning**:
